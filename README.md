# 🤖 ESP32 Voice Communication 🎙️

This repository contains code for ESP32-based voice communication using websockets. The code uses the ArduinoWebsockets library for handling websockets communication, and the Button2 library for handling button input.

The ESP32 is able to communicate with a websockets server, sending and receiving audio data. The system uses a button to trigger the voice communication, which can then be transmitted over the websockets connection.




# 🛠️ Setup

To use this code, you will need an ESP32 development board, along with the necessary libraries. The libraries required are:

[WiFi library](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme)

[ArduinoWebsockets library](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme)

[Button2 library](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme)

Once you have these libraries installed, you can upload the code to your ESP32 board.

however i already included these libraries in platorm.ini file

# 🚀 Usage

To use the system, simply press the button connected to the ESP32 board. This will trigger the voice communication, which will be transmitted over the websockets connection.
